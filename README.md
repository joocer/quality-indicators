**quality-indicators** are a set of simple quality measures for Python libraries.

## Maintainability

Calculates a [Maintainability Index](https://radon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)
score for each Python module found outside the `tests` folder.

**Quality Bar**: All modules exceed 50

## Currency

This is a simple composition analysis scanner for Python; it uses the manifest of
currently installed packages as the composition, then looks up components on PyPI
to determine the latest version and a list of vulnerable components maintained by pyup
and OSV to determine if any have security weaknesses. 

**Quality Bar**: Less than 20% of components STALE  
**Quality Bar**: 0 components with patchable security weaknesses
